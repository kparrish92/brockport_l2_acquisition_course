# Read R scripts into .Rmd file

- We can load R scripts into our HTML presentation

```{r, 'source_libs'}
source("../scripts/libs.R")
```

- Take note of the path. Where does `libs.R` live? Where does this presentation 
live?

- How can we load the `poisson_regression.R` script into this presentation so 
that we have access to our models/plots and other objects?
