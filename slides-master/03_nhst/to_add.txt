scientific theories are fallible and require testing

Theory Falsification

- Basically, there is no way to prove a theory, we can 
only support it:
  - We can however, disprove a theory if our observations 
  or experimental results disconfirm it
- Research designed to confirm a theory is useless unless 
it subjects the theory to risk of falsification:
  - It must attempt to disconfirm the theory
  - It must be possible at least in principle to 
  disconfirm a scientific theory

---

Theory Falsification

- If the hypothesis is disconfirmed and the theory is therefore falsified we can:
  - Reject the theory entirely
  - Make changes to it and re-test it

- If the hypothesis is confirmed and the theory is therefore 
not falsified, on the other hand, we never know for a fact 
that any given theory is true:
  - Just because the theory is not rejected doesn’t mean it 
  is the best explanation because other theories might 
  explain things better
  - However, we can increase our confidence in the strength 
  of a theory by continuing to subject it to this cycle of 
  observation, theory construction, and hypothesis testing

- We can approach Verisimilitude (“likeness to truth”) 
asymptotically, but can never be 100% our theory represents 
the truth:
  - We can have a great deal of confidence in a theory, but 
  can never be absolutely sure the theory is correct.

Fallibility of Empirical Support

- The more you love your theory the more you need to try 
and “kill” it:
  – We need to try and disprove the theory in every way 
  possible to increase our confidence in it
  – Nietzsche: “that which does not kill us makes us stronger”

---

“Boldness in Conjecture, Austerity in Refutation”

- Popper’s famous quote:
  - Make risky predictions (boldness in conjecture) and then 
try to severely kill/disprove your theory (austerity in 
refutation)
– Science cannot progress as long as you play it safe

What Happens When You Try to Test a Theory?

- You can't test a theory directly:
  - But there are intermediate steps you can take
- For example, if you want to examine the effects of 
stress, you are faced several questions to address

---

What Happens When You Try to Test a Theory?

- Select lab rats as a model of human stress: 
  - How similar are we to rats?
  - How similar are lab rats to wild rats?

- How do you go about stressing rats? 
  - You might force them to swim

- How do you know it's stressed?
  - You might do an open field test and count its feces
- You wind up correlating forced swimming by rats to the 
number of feces produced in an open field test
